<h1>What is this?</h1> 
I was inspired by a lot of github guides for people trying to prepare for interviews at the major tech companies such as 
google, facebook, etc. As someone who is self taught in CS and coding, it is a struggle trying to figure out what skills I need to 
be able to ace the interviews in the tech industry. I've unfortunately experienced first hand with white boarding and how tough it 
is which unfortunately cost me the opportunity to work in the industry! So this guide was born! It's currently under construction 
so bear with me!
